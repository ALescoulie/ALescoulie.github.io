## [QSAR Prediction of Monomer Pair Reactivity Ratios](https://github.com/ALescoulie/QSAR-monomer-reactivity-prediction)
### Summer 2020 - Present
Working with Dr. Erik Sapper we began a project with the goal of using quantum chemical descriptors to predict monomer pair reactivity ratios for radical copolymerization. Descriptors were calculated using Dragon 7 and fed into a keras machine learning model built in Jupyter Notebook. To avoid overfitting with a small data set of fifty molecules, an iterated K-fold method was implemented. Currently we are working to optimize the models to the greatest extent possible, and publish a manuscript based on project

## Trajectory Analysis of Activated MEK01
### Fall 2020 - Present
Working in the [Computational Chemistry Group](https://armcdona.github.io) I began a project building on the work of a previous student using molecular dynamics to study the structure of MEK01 a duel action human kinase involved in the cell cycle. The analysis uses the MDAnalysis library of python.
